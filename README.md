# Welcome to jakpartment deployment repository!

Since the jakpartment project web app is deployed on share.streamlit.io, and currently sharing online on streamlit has trouble accessing relative paths. Every necessary components in the app.py has to be in the same root folder. For example, if I store a pickled scikit-learn object in a folder called 'Models', I cannot call that model by using a relative path approach in the app.py. This issue is not present if we want to deploy the web app in our local system. (If we're only deploying it within our local Python environment in our laptop, we still can use relative paths)

Since this project houses a lot of files, it can be very messy to store everything at the root folder. That's why on the main page, I decided to keep things tidy there. You can fork the repository from that page and run it on your local system.
